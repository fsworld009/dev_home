About this repository
==========================
I'm trying to create a portable development folder integrate with msys2, git(under msys2), gvim, and programming language binaries such as python, ruby, Java, under Windows 7 x64.  
This repository is the home folder for this portable development environment.

I want to manage my vimrc and this home folder seperately so I put my vimrc config in another repository:  
https://github.com/fsworld009/vimrc

Installation 
==========================
1. Run install.bat
2. Start with sh.bat
    1. (Better: sh.bat with ConEmu)
3. sh msys2_setup_script.sh
